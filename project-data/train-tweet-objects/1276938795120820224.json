    "text": "@realcliffcohn @HappyAnvilArt @adamhousley @LisaMarieBoothe Houston death rate is 550 people out of 6M.  What is NYC?  Houston had not built up any herd immunity like NYC.  The protests were like a grenade into the phased process.  Houston ICU's were at 64% for non-Covid due to the shut downs.  Now delayed again.  High cost for protests."
