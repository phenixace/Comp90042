    "text": "@syabilazriAS @MedCrisis I checked the chart, the drop is there in the data. The wk 52 median(: 782.5) is not the lowest of the year - that would be for wk 35(: 747.5). If I were to guess, I'd say more people travel out of London the wk between xmas and new year, i.e. fewer deaths are locally recorded?"
