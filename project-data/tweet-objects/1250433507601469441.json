    "text": "@StephenAtHome @DrLaPook Why was Dr. LaPook evasive in so many of his answers? Example: \"When can we hug again?\". Answer: \"Hugging is good for you.\"  If viewers want evasion, we get that with Trump's press conferences. How about a good honest, \"I don't know.\"? Unless this was satire it was #wastedtime",
